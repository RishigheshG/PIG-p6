# PIG using Python
### This is my 6th Project which is part of my 100 Python Projects in 100 Days series

PIG is a game where the player rolls a die and they can constantly keep rolling as much as they want, every roll adds up the score (eg. if the player rolls a 6,4 and 2, their score is 12) but if the player rolls a 1, they end up losing their points and would have to start from 0 again.The first player to cross 50 points wins.
